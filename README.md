You need to follow each link and get the size (in kb) of the linked HTML (no assets)
and the description to display in the JSON
Each element in the JSON results array should contain ‘title’, ‘unit_price’, ‘size’ and
‘description’ keys corresponding to items in the table.
Additionally, there should be a total field which is a sum of all unit prices on the page.
